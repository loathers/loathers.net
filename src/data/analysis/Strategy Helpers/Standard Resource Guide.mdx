### Beginner’s Guide to Planning Resources for a Standard Ascension Speedrun

First, you’ll want a resource planning sheet (similar to [this one](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10hqe7_QHIZiFeS5z2yIVTxOw4hEQd78C2BK5gysl-2Q/edit#gid=465011855) created in March 2024) that comprehensively lists all available resources. 

Now that you know all the resources available to you, you need to figure out where to use them in the most efficient manner. That will require answering the questions below.

#### 1. How will you consistently reduce combat rate by at least 25%?

Many quests require finding particular [noncombat adventures](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Combat_Frequency). Any item or effect that has the enchantment **Monsters will be less attracted to you** will reduce combat frequency by 5% (up to a soft cap of 25; after that it will reduce combat frequency by 1%). Perming Smooth Movements and Sonata of Sneakiness will provide 10% in a non-avatar run and, generally speaking, a full set of Standard iotms will be able to provide the rest. If you are not able to guarantee the 25% reduction of combat rate, pulling [duonoculars](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Duonoculars), a [red shoe](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Red_shoe), or a [ring of conflict](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Ring_of_conflict) is suggested.

#### 2. How will you reach level 11?

When speedrunning, fighting regular monsters with as much [monster level](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Monster_Level) that you can survive and boosting [stat gains from fights](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Stat_Gains_from_Fights) is necessary to level quickly and open up more locations to adventure in. However, that alone is not enough to get to level 11 (this requires 10,816 [substats](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Advancement)!) as early as you’d like to enable optimal location adventuring. To accomplish this requires committing resources to gain thousands of main stat experience.

##### 2024 meta:
Using your [model train set](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Model_Train_Set).
##### Previous metas:
- Fighting [free](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Free_fights) [scaling monsters](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Special_Monsters) while boosting main stat or experience gain
	- Scalar sources: [Book of Facts](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Recall_Facts:_Monster_Habitats), [Chest Mimic](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Chest_Mimic), [The Neverending Party](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/The_Neverending_Party)
	- Experience gain: [makeshift garbage shirt](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Makeshift_garbage_shirt)
- Boosting familiar experience with [Vintner wines](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/1950_Vampire_Vintner_wine) or [Cookbookbat foods](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Roasted_vegetable_focaccia) and using stat-providing skills from [Grey Goose](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Grey_Goose) against free scaling monsters.
- Eating [high stat foods](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Guilty_sprout) with [Red Rocket](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Red_rocket)

#### 3. How can you complete each quest?
For each step of a quest, you’ll want to think about how you can complete it in the fewest number of adventures. And there are certainly multiple ways to complete the same step! It might involve [summoning or copying monsters](https://www.loathers.net/analysis/faxes-and-summons/), [forcing/stealing item drops, duplicating item drops](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DX75n02AVJsmo_hzCV7KGEqw8-7NmNP7IugLEZNWBZA/edit#gid=0), forcing noncombat adventures, banishing monsters, sniffing monsters, using 11-leaf clovers, unique iotm interactions, etc.

For example:
| Quest | Step | FK | FR | FNC | B | S | C| 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Spooky Forest | N/A | X | X | X | | | |
| Typical Tavern | N/A | X | X | | | | |
| Macguffin | Hidden Apartment | X | X | X | X | X | X |

FK → Free Kill<br></br>
FR → Free Run<br></br>
FNC → Force Noncombat<br></br>
B → Banishes<br></br>
S → Monster Summons<br></br>
C → Monster Copies

#### 4. How will you complete all quests to maximize resource utilization?

Now that you have brainstormed the various ways all the quests can be completed,you need to decide where you will commit each resource. If multiple quest steps can utilize the same resource, use it where you can to maximize the turns saved. This aspect often requires significant planning and may evolve as you gain experience with different paths or resources.

As an example, both the Spooky Forest quest and the Macguffin Quest (Hidden Apartment step) can make use of a noncombat forcer. In The Spooky Forest, that saves an average of 2.5 turns if you are reducing the combat rate by 25%, while in The Hidden Apartment, it can save up to 8 turns!

#### 5. Are you generating the needed turns for your run? Are you hitting your desired daycount?

You’ll probably need to complete a few ascensions before you can can answer this one, but if you're unable to generate sufficient turns to finish your run in the desired amount of days, identify resources that can be repurposed for turn generation rather than turn reduction.

#### 6. Can you optimize turns outside of quests?

It is worth warning you that thinking this way is a gateway drug to attempting [sicko mode](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/User:The_ErosionSeeker/SICKO_Mode) in ascensions. But, it is beneficial to consider how you can reduce turn count that is not directly related to quests.
Some examples:
Free-killing shadow slabs with goose drones while item drop is over 500% is a way to (statistically) save more than 1 turn per summoned slab through shadow brick drops.
Stealing tattered scraps of paper from bookbats as an early source of Everything Looks Green.
Summoning, using Spooky VHS Tapes, and Yellow Raying Green Ops Soldiers for 2 green smoke bomb drops. Consider adding item duplication methods.
