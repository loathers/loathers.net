November's Peace Turkey was all about keeping up tradition. The December IOTM, the TakerSpace, is a similarly traditional achievement. The important tradition TPTB are celebrating this month is the traditional reminder TPTB get near the end of the year that the last workshed in standard is about to rotate out.
