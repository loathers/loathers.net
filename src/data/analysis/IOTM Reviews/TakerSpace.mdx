November's Peace Turkey was all about keeping up tradition. The December IOTM, the TakerSpace, is a similarly traditional achievement. The important tradition TPTB are celebrating this month is the traditional reminder TPTB get near the end of the year that the last workshed in standard is about to rotate out. They then will, as is tradition, add the new workshed in the last two months to overlap with the existing workshed instead of saving it for January, forcing them to make a new workshed 24 months later as opposed to 35 months later. Let's uncork our celebratory bottle of 3638 B.C. Chateau Filth Hermitage and examine this year's traditional workshed, the TakerSpace.

## General Summary

The TakerSpace is a workshed that allows you to combine a bunch of pirate-themed goodies. Every day, your workshed is supplied with 3 each of "stolen spices", "robbed rums", "absconded-with anchors", and "misappropriated mainmasts". You also get 1 "snatched silk" and 1 "gaffled gold". None of these are actual in-game items -- they're (essentially) just currency that you can spend in your TakerSpace. (You can save these; the TakerSpace will just continue accumulating these goodies and allow you to spend them whenever you feel like it. Nice for aftercore!)

With so much currency and so many different combinations, you can make a LOT of items in your TakerSpace. To wit, here are the possible craftables from your TakerSpace, along with the item's cost in materials. I have (very roughly) ordered them according to speedrun value. We'll discuss them in the next section!

One last note -- this Crimbo, there was a weird, random interaction between TakerSpace and Crimbo's Veteran's Day Island, where using a key on the NC got you one of the spice/rum/anchor/masts. It is **entirely possible** that there are more of these that speedrunners will only discover next year, when the model train set isn't on for all of your combats in a run. If that happens, I'll try to add that here!

## A quick aside to discuss the concept of Worksheds 

The TakerSpace, as a workshed, is a tiny bit out of the ordinary. From a speedrunning perspective, all IOTM worksheds either do something as you keep adventuring with the given workshed or require resources you gain as you adventure throughout your run. To use the prior 6 IOTM worksheds as examples:

- The model train set does something every single combat you start, in a repeating pattern of eights.
- The cold medicine cabinet gives you an item (essentially) every 20 turns, dependent on the mix of combat environments in your previous 20 combats.
- The diabolic pizza cube's pizzas require input items that you gain as you adventure, allowing you to make better pizzas as you route new items into your pizza setup.
- The Asdon Martin gives you a banish every 30 turns, and requires food drops from your combats both for buffs and to power up the banish (and a 1/day freekill yellow ray that doesn't give Everything Looks Yellow).
- The Mayo Clinic doesn't really -change- throughout the day, it just requires large quantities of meat as an input to benefit from its abilities, meaning you generally can't do everything you want from it on turn 1.
- The DNA Splicing Lab requires that you use its associated 3/day combat items, the DNA Extraction Syringe, on 3 separate monsters for single-use potions and one all-day intrinsic that are dependent on the phylums you spliced. (So, this one only really takes 3 turns of use if you can summon up the right phylums.)

TakerSpace doesn't really fit into the "workshed" mold. Which is funny, since (in a manner of speaking) the exact thing I do in my woodworking shed is combine items to make things. Perhaps this will be a new era of workshed usage that more closely matches real-life worksheds, where you get items and put them together and that's that. (It probably won't, TPTB make IOTMs that sound funny and good, they assuredly did not think of TakerSpace the way I'm thinking about it.)

Regardless. What DO you use these currency for? Luckily, there's a whole section about that coming right up!

## Speedrun Applicability

Welcome to the whole section about that! There are essentially 5 ascension-relevant items in the TakerSpace that are useful to the speedsters among us:

The first (and most useful) item is the **pirate dinghy**. It's quite rare for TPTB to mint items that provide ways to avoid the Shore's dreaded 9 turn tax. The Candy Cane Sword Cane cut 3 turns off it, but in unrestricted most of us were still using the Yellow Puck to unlock the shore. Now, I think people will (likely) ignore those puck turns and simply use the TakerSpace on turn 1 to grab the dinghy. This item saves 9 turns in the base case and costs 1 ANCHOR, 1 MAST, and 1 SILK.

The second item of interest is the **jolly roger flag**. This item is more powerful than it is, but it reminds me a bit of 2018's [balanced antler](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Balanced_antler). The antler gave you a single reroll against beasts, which served as a full beast banish in a 1-beast zone and a harsh drop in beast frequency in zones with 2+ beasts but other possible items. I don't know if anyone ever pulled it for a speedrun, but it would've made a great pull for the Palindome back in the day. The jolly roger flag activates 75% of the time, and banishes monsters with above-average meat for the zone. This is a really cool ability, especially when paired with the power of Recall Habitat from the Book of Facts -- the monsters you place via habitats impact the average meat drop of the zone, allowing you to get more exact about what's banished and what's not. Without habitats, **during the 75% of turns where it activates**, the Jolly Roger Flag serves as... 
- A full banish of the sabre-toothed goat in the Goatlet (avg: 50)
- A full banish of all non-topiary golems (5 monsters!) in the Twin Peak (avg: 40)
- A full banish of the skeletal sommelier in the Haunted Wine cellar (avg: 50)
- A full banish of the man with the red buttons, red herring, and red snapper in the Red Zeppelin (avg: 93)
- A full banish of the pygmy orderlies in the Hidden Bowling Alley (avg is 129 w/ janitor in the pool, 141 w/ janitor out of the pool)
- A full banish of the pygmy assault squad in the Hidden Park (avg: 140)
- A full banish of the headhunter and the lawyer in the Hidden Office Building... if you've banished the janitor in the hidden park (avg: 141 with janitor, 166 without -- the accountant's average is 150!)
There are a few more (like the bodyguard bats, which theoretically would get banished by the flag), but these probably rank as the spiciest and most interesting ones. The one issue for it in bleeding edge speedruns is that it's (effectively) 75% of a banish, not a full banish, whereas a full banish ensures you won't encounter the thing you don't want to see. Then again, it's also a *pre* banish going into the zone, which has its own power level. Still. This item, when used properly, saves 75% of at least 6-9 banishes (maybe even 9-12, if you use this in a run that uses the Hidden Park to avoid summoning up accountants) for a variant but nice range of 4-9 turns saved in value. The flag costs 1 RUM, 1 ANCHOR, and 1 SILK.

The third item of interest? The **silky pirate drawers.** Please see the <Link to="/analysis/2024-11-peace-turkey/">Peace Turkey</Link> article for more on how to evaluate minus combat buffs. If you have this the whole run, it's around a 2 turn value. Realistically, though, you can't wear it in every NC in your NC hunt... because it happens to cost 2 SILK, which you won't have until day 2. RIP.

The fourth item of interest is the anchor bomb. It's a very simple freerun-banish combat item, so it's always worth 1 turn in delay (and a small bit extra if you really need the banish for something, like perhaps the Yossarian junkyard quest). This will likely see a bit more play as a softcore pull than an actual in-run use -- unfortunately, the cost of the bomb rules out any other anchor uses, because it costs 1 RUM, 3 ANCHOR, 1 MAST, 1 GOLD. 

The fifth (and in my view final) item of serious interest is the **deft pirate hook**. It's a bit better for fun aftercore purposes (like the current Crimbo, where it effectively doubles your combat take on Spirits in the Holiday Islands), but it has a little bit of a fun twist by unlocking some pickpockets for classes that can't pickpocket (while allowing a chance of a double-up pickpocket for classes that can). Because the pirate hook is just a normal pickpocket rather than a special one, it's mainly useful for things like giving you a slight extra shot at more stone wool or bubblin crudes. It can also be useful in the Shadow Rifts, as it seems to bypass the zone's drop rate restrictions, giving you a slight extra boost for more shadow goodies. It also can just ambiently increase your gains in a few fights! Does have some anti-synergy with Goose (IE, can remove things from the drop pool you were intending to goose dupe) but is overall a pleasant and reasonably fun use of an offhand. Worth about a turn, probably, only happening in rare occasions where it bails you out. It costs 1 ANCHOR, 1 MAST, and 1 GOLD.

So, those are cool! The thing is... you can't really get all of them. I think next year, when my beloved 2-day hardcore metas will return, there will be a lot of fun facestabbing potential around saving zones for D2 Jolly Roger Flag usage. But until then, you only have 1 day of resources, and that means you can really only snag 1 of the top 4 items. Helpfully, you CAN snag both the dinghy and the hook, which is a nice combo. If you get both, that leaves you with 3 SPICE, 2 RUM, 1 ANCHOR, 1 MAST. You can really get whatever the hell you want at that point -- nothing else dramatically moves the needle.

## 2024 In-Standard Synergies

- Not really a synergy, more of an anti-synergy; a nice chunk of the full-run value of 2023's <Link to="/analysis/2023-12-candy-cane-sword/">Candy Cane Sword Cane</Link> was that it allowed you to get 2 Shore Inc. Trip Scrips for the price of 1. Due to the fact that this IOTM's best feature is the island access, technically speaking, the extra CCSC scrip isn't really valuable anymore; even if you still do a shore trip, it will be done to get a compass, which only costs 1 scrip. (Both are still great items!)

## Overall Rating

We rate the TakerSpace as a tier 1 IOTM. It's a bit of an odd duck. In a 3+ day run, I really struggle to see how you'd possibly get 8-9 turns of value for it every day. But in the current 1-day meta, it really is only saving you 6-7 turns with the dinghy + the hook due to CCSC's awesome shore interaction. But this is the kind of IOTM that's essentially MADE for a 2-day meta, getting you a good 6-7 turns on D1, then 7-8 turns on D2 from clutch Jolly Roger banishes atop cute habitat tricks and bleeding edge play. There's something for everyone here! (Also, the theming is cute, my overly long paean to worksheds aside.)
