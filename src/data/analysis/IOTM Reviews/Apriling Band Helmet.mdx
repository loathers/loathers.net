The people have demanded a hat, and a hat they shall receive. The **Apriling band helmet** is the April IOTM, and it's filled to the brim with instruments perfect for Apriling along to the beat of your own drum.

## General Summary

The Apriling band helmet is a hat with a variety of pleasant enchantments:

- Maximum HP/MP +25  
- Never Fumble  
- 75% Chance of Preventing Negative Status Attacks  
- +40% Meat from Monsters  
- All Attributes +10%  

While the +meat% sounds impressive, the most important part of this hat is the final special enchantment:
- **Conduct the Band!**

The power of this ability is twofold. One, it lets you set one of three intrinsic buffs, all of which can save serious turns if used correctly:

- -10% Combat Frequency
- +10% Combat Frequency
- +25% Booze Drops, +50% Food Drops, +100% Candy Drops

Second, you can choose 2 melting Apriling instruments to take per day, each of which have slightly useful enchantments and a thrice-per-day usable function:
- **Saxophone** - Lucky! source
- **Quad tom** - summons a free Sandworm
- **Tuba** - sneak source
- **Band staff** - grants random effects
- **Piccolo** - gives your current familiar +40 experience

## Speedrun Applicability

The benefits of combat frequency manipulation should be immediately obvious. What is not obvious, is that these three effects apply *even without the helmet equipped*! On top of being generally useful when hunting non-combats, the +combat frequency can help you find **Ninja Snowman Assassins**, or avoid useless non-combats in **Whitey's Grove** and **The Upper Chambers**. Finally, the +Booze/Food/Candy effect is helpful when looking for **Chateau de Vinegar** and **blasting soda**, **bird rib** and **lion oil**, and elsewhere. This enchantment can be changed every 11 adventures spent, so it is actually quite flexible, even if you'll rarely ever want to change it from -10% combat frequency.

While those are fairly useful, the main draw of the Apriling band helmet is the daily equipment. These melting equips are equipped with powerful 3/day functions that give you lots of fun options. There are three you really want to consider, with one honorable mention.

- **Sneaks** are always in-demand, and the **Tuba** grants 3 a day. This is good in every 95% combat frequency zone, and with so many extra sneaks available, you may even wish to use them in 90% or even 85% zones that you really don't want to spend extra time in. 
- **Lucky** as a resource has been limited to 3 a day through hermit clovers, followed by 1 more from an **August Scepter** skill, and 3 rarely-taken but possible through the use of Astral Energy Drinks. The **saxophone** 3-ups the August Scepter, granting another whopping 3 shots of Lucky per day. In paths where you are unable to rely on the **Model Train Set** to get you a bridge, an extra 9 bridge parts per day for 3 turns can really put in work. Of mild importance, the sax has +2 hot/stench resist, which is sometimes helpful for reaching resistance thresholds in  **The Haunted Kitchen**.
- **Familiar XP** is something that we've been getting more commonly now, and with 3x40 familiar XP available to be allocated, the **piccolo** delivers for those familiars that really want to gain poundage ASAP.

The **quad tom** receives an honorable mention for being a drum machine substitute for the **Arid, Extra-Dry Desert**, although that will not be needed as long as the **cursed monkey's paw** can net you a real drum machine for just one wish. Still, it's entirely possible that in future metas you'll want to summon up one quad tom on one day of your run for 2 free fights and avoiding the Oasis altogether.

## 2024 In-Standard Synergies

Almost everything about the Apriling band helmet is independently good. The only IotM synergy lies with the **apriling band piccolo**, which is a +10 weight familiar equipment that grants familiar XP. Here are some ideas for how to use it:

- +40 famXP transforms a 25-XP **Grey Goose** into a 65-XP one, instantly allowing for 3 drones
- +120 famXP allows a **Chest Mimic** to extrude two egg copies, or one egg "fax"

Because you get 3 shots of 40 XP, rather than 1 shot of 120 XP, you can really get creative with how you distribute the gains; this will benefit those who can use the experience at maximum utility by splitting their uses up and getting to exact thresholds rather than overloading your Goose.

## Overall Rating

We'd rate the Apriling band helmet a tier 1 IotM. This IotM requires very little micromanagement and offers several on-demand instrument functions with no cooldowns. Sneaks alone are worth about 3 adv each, so the Apriling band helmet is going to save upwards of 10 adv a day. A very solid, very straightforward hat for very solid, very straightforward band geeks.
