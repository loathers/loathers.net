Imagine the Tome of Clip Art. Now imagine it with a way cooler UI and more yams. If you can’t imagine it, you don’t have to, because the **Mayam Calendar** is the May 2024 IotM and you can get it to experience all things tuberic and concentric.

## General Summary

The Mayam Calendar is a usable item. Thrice per day, you can select unique pictographic combinations to receive items and other boons.

Notable benefits include:
- 100 turns of +30% item drops
- +100 fxp
- +5 free rests
- 4 bridge parts
- 1 goat cheese
- +5 adventures
- +5 PvP Fites
- yams!
In addition to these cool things, specific combinations also give more stuff!
- 15-turn banish runaway (Vessel + Yam + Cheese + Explosion)
- food that gives you another goat cheese (Yam + Meat + Cheese + Yam)
- +55% meat drop accessory (Yam + Meat + Eyepatch + Yam)
- +100% Food drop buff (Yam + Yam + Cheese + Clock)
- and more!

The tricky part is that each pictogram can be used only once per day*, so most of the best results are mutually exclusive. You may need to make a spreadsheet or recipe list to remember your preferred combinations. It’s basically yam-based, concentric Sudoku. In other words, it’s nothing like Sudoku.

*Once per ascension, visiting the Hidden Temple’s sundial resets your calendar, which means you can pick a second set of choices in one day. This will be relevant soon.

## Speedrun Applicability
We can group speedrun applicability in two parts: things that are useful on their own, and things with IotM synergy. Here are some examples of inherently helpful results:

- **Bridge parts** are obviously useful, roughly representing one Autumn-aton send each. Word of warning, these are random, so 3/1 and 4/0 splits are possible!
- **Yams** are an extra source of turngen. While the food may be overshadowed by the Cookbookbat, yam martinis are 5 adv for 1 drunk, and can mix into even better drinks.
- Everyone loves **+5 adv** and +5 fites! Although turngen is not a major concern in high-level play, an extra chunk of Adventures can ease your resources and grant a lot of flexibility.
- Choosing the **yam and swiss** grants 1 goat cheese instantly, and a second one when eating it. If trying to get dairy gets your goat, waiting until day 2, or using the Temple Reset allows you to get 3 goat cheese without spending a turn.
- The **yamility belt** is a +55% meat accessory, outclassing every other accessory available in Standard. This can easily save a turn for the Nuns.
- Although the **stuffed yam stinkbomb** can seem underwhelming at only 15 banish duration, that's usually enough for your needs. It's also a free run, for situations that require banishing and delay burning.

**2024 In-Standard Synergies**

It wouldn't be an Item of the Month if it didn't synergize with other Items of the Month. Here are some ways to use it:
- **+5 free rests** is a no-brainer for the **Cincho de Mayo**. Reaching the next sneak can easily be worth 5 turns, and so the 5 extra free rests is a lot of extra cinch to spend. Use the Temple Reset, and 10 is almost an entire extra Sneak!
- **+100 fxp **is enormous for the **Grey Goose** or the **Chest Mimic**, representing up to 6 drones or 2 eggs. This can also pump up another familiar in a pinch, maybe a Jill-of-All-Trades if you really need it. In situations where you are somehow restricted, such as in WereProfessor, this +100 or even +200 fxp can really shine.

**Overall Rating**

We'd rate the Mayam Calendar a tier 3 IotM. Although not overwhelmingly powerful, this IotM requires very little micromanagement to save turns and ascend well in a variety of ways.
