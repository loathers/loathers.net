The McHugeLarge deluxe ski set comes as an enormous duffel bag. That's right, kids, duffel bags are BACK. And by BACK, I mean that's where you wear it. On your back. You know, like a... duffel bag? Wait, what? I actually looked this up because I got confused -- according to the internet, a haven of truth devoid of liars and cheats, it's now *haute couture* to wear a duffel bag like a backpack. The acclaimed "backpacks.global" website claims that wearing a duffel bag on your back looks "stylish and modern", which means that I am officially less in-the-know about modern fashion than TPTB. Oh well. At least I can ski off my embarrassment.

## General Summary

The McHugeLarge is autopulled as a back item, the McHugeLarge duffel bag. It's a decent enough back item, featuring +15% item drops, the maximum TPTB will ever place on a back item so long as Cannonfire40 draws breath. But if you go to your equipment page, you can \[open\] the duffel bag, allowing you to get at four more pieces of equipment inside. These pieces are:

- The **McHugeLarge right pole**, a 1-handed weapon with +25% weapon damage, along with access to the combat skill "McHugeLarge Stab"
- The **McHugeLarge left pole**, an offhand with +25% spell damage, along with access to the combat skill "McHugeLarge Slash"
- The **McHugeLarge left ski**, an accessory with -5% combat, along with access to the combat skill "McHugeLarge Avalanche"
- The **McHugeLarge right ski**, an accessory with +5% combat, along with access to the combat skill "McHugeLarge Ski Plow"

However, those are only the base enchantments. As you equip more pieces of the gear, you add additional hot damage, cold res, and initiative to the mix on *all* pieces of the gear. For a simple table, here's what to expect for the extra boosts as you equip more and more gear.

| Pieces of Gear Equipped | Per-Gear Bonus | Total Bonus |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| One Piece | None | None |
| Two Pieces | +1 cold res, +5 hot damage, +10% init | +2 cold res, +10 hot damage, +20% init |
| Three Pieces | +1 cold res, +5 hot damage, +10% init | +3 cold res, +15 hot damage, +30% init |
| Four Pieces | +2 cold res, +10 hot damage, +20% init | +8 cold res, +40 hot damage, +80% init |
| Five Pieces | +3 cold res, +15 hot damage, +30% init | +15 cold res, +75 hot damage, +150% init |

Quite a lot! In addition, here's the lowdown on the combat skills you get from each of the poles and skis.

- RIGHT POLE: **McHugeLarge Stab** deals physical and sleaze damage to your foe. (Once per fight)
- LEFT POLE: **McHugeLarge Slash** makes your opponent bleed, which makes them easier to track -- it's a sniff, making them much more likely to appear in their native zones! (3x per day)
- LEFT SKI: **McHugeLarge Avalanche** clears the area of monsters, forcing a noncombat adventure to happen next (3x per day)
- RIGHT SKI: **McHugeLarge Ski Plow** delevels your foe (11x per day)

Finally, wearing all five pieces of the gear counts as wearing the eXtreme Slopes Gear for the purposes of the Mt. McLargeHuge quest. Neat!

# Speedrun Applicability

Let's start with the equipment bonuses. First off, the cold resistence is a fantastic amount. It does take up several slots, but it also ensures that you only need one bembershoot, which means that instead of summoning 2 Mmm-brr mouthwashes alongside 3 bembershoots, it's now effectively costless to summon an extra mouthwash. Beyond that, the back slot was uncontested and you were only getting 2 cold res from the Apriling Tuba in the weapon/offhand slots. That means we're netting +11 cold res and 1 extra mouthwash from the ski set, *dramatically* easing the leveling picture for us. Great stuff.

The two best enchants beyond the cold res, to me, are the +/- combat skis. It's rare to get that kind of equipment on turn 0, and as discussed in the Peace Turkey article, combat rate modifiers that can be applied to every search in your run are inherently pretty valuable. 

In terms of the other modifiers... the initiative is nice, though I think that is one where it's pretty unlikely to be a major help; there are better contenders in almost every slot for initiative, so you'll almost always be better off simply equipping the higher base equipment (Bat Wings, Spring Shoes, etc) rather than the McHugeLarge gear. The hot damage may help mildly with the Tavern, though my guess is that we'll just use Song of Sauce to simplify it. The %weapon/spell damage is... fine. People who loop Community Service runs might use it?

With the bonuses down, let's turn to the skills. The deleveler and the damage skills are fine -- the usual sort of "throw on a few combat trivializers" move that makes IOTMs relevant and comfortable for people who aren't bleeding edge speedrunners. That leaves two:

- The noncombat forcer is awesome. One month into the year and we've already clawed back over half the NC forcers we lost from last standard! Mathematically, a marginal noncombat force is worth about 2 turns; three of them is a great boon to the masses.
- The olfaction is also awesome. INSERT SPADING HERE ONCE IT IS DONE

Finally, there's the lovely extra touch that the equipment can serve as the eXtreme Slopes outfit. In order to make it to the top of Icy Peak, you need a way to scale the peak. You can either do so via eXtreme stunts or the ninja gear. Traditionally, everyone does the ninja gear, as it just requires fighting three assassins. Conversely, getting the eXtreme Slopes gear usually takes 5-10 turns by itself. And that isn't even the end to it, as you still need 3 turns to the top -- one superlikely, then two noncombats in a 95% combat rate zone. But cutting the 5-10 turns of finding the gear makes things a good bit more interesting; instead of a tradeoff of 8-13 turns versus 3, the tradeoff now is three summons for assassins (with hopes that you can cut that number by getting one naturally and purple-candle copying them in delay) versus one superlikely and two forced NCs. Where it was a laughably obvious choice in favor of the assassin route, there's at least an argument for the slopes now, especially once Chest Mimic rotates out and we aren't in a glut of summons. Which is cool! Choices are fun, folks!

## 2025 In-Standard Synergies

- The olfaction skill (McHugeLarge Slash) has strong synergy with the <Link to="/analysis/2024-01-chest-mimic/">Chest Mimic (2024)</Link>. When there's something you want to encounter a bunch of times, one of the best ways to achieve that is to summon the monster up, olfact it, and then enter the zone. Assuming this sniff stacks with olfaction, it'll make this trick a good bit more powerful while you can stack, while also allowing players who don't actually have Transcendent Olfaction to benefit from these skills. (And avatar paths, too! Avatar paths LOVE a good sniff.)
- As previously discussed, the cold resistence is extremely synergistic with the Mmm-brr Mouthwash from the <Link to="/analysis/2024-09-sept-ember-censer/">Sept-Ember Censer</Link>. Depends on your starting point, but this is going to represent an extra 2-5k stats on turn 0. *That's dope!*

## Overall Rating

We'd rate the McHugeLarge ski set as a tier 1 IOTM. You save a few turns from the +/- combat equips, likely 3-4 turns in routing benefit over the course of a full run from the dramatically increased powerleveling from the cold res, 6 turns from the noncombat forcing mechanism, and 2-3 turns from the sniff. It's quite strong, and a great IOTM for both low and high shiny players alike. Don't get frozen out -- buy it now!
