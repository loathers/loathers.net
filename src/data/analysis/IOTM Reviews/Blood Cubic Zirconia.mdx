It's been a very busy few months for me, with some personal life issues and my job being extremely busy. I have had virtually no time for KOL; I haven't even been running automated turns. But ever since this month began with the Blood Cubic Zirconia, I've wanted to make absolutely sure I write an overview for it prior to its departure from Mr. Store. Spoiler alert: you're *really* going to want this one!

## General Summary

The blood cubic zirconia (BCZ) is an accessory. As with most IOTM equipment, the enchantments aren't really why you want to buy it, but they do exist. Where L = your current player level, the enchantments are...

- Serious Spooky Resistance (+3)
- + L\*3 Spooky Damage
- + L\*3 Damage to Spooky Spells 
- + 20% Chance of Critical Hit 
- Weakens Monster on Critical Hit 
- + 20% Meat from Monsters

In addition, the BCZ gives you access to 3 combat skills when worn:

- **BCZ: Blood Geyser** 游댮 (A 30-round stun.)
- **BCZ: Refracted Gaze** 游댯 (Replaces the monster's drop table with the drop tables of all other monsters in the current zone.)
- **BCZ: Sweat Bullets** 游릭 (A free kill! Hooray!!!)

... as well as 6 non-combat skills:

- **BCZ: Blood Bath** 游댮 (Gives 30 turns of a +5*L ML effect, with +100% weapon damage & +5% combat frequency as tertiary modifiers. Caps at +75.)
- **BCZ: Create Blood Thinner** 游댮 (Summons a potency-1 spleen item; 50 turns of +100 HP & +1000% HP.)
- **BCZ: Dial it up to 11** 游댯 (Gives 30 turns of an effect granting +111% spell damage, +111% myst, and making all spells stagger.)
- **BCZ: Prepare Spinal Tapas** 游댯 (Summons a potency-1 food item; 3.5 adv/fullness and 30 turns of +300% mysticality.)
- **BCZ: Craft a Pheromone Cocktail** 游릭 (Summons a potency-1 drink; 4 adv/drunk, and the drink gives one charge of a turn-taking all-day banish.)
- **BCZ: Sweat Equity** 游릭 (Gives 30 turns of +40% meat drop.)

Instead of an MP cost, each cast of a BCZ skill will consume substats. The scaling is pretty light up until about cast #7, at which point it starts getting quite high. To wit:

- Cast #1 costs 11 substats
- Cast #2 costs 23 substats
- Cast #3 costs 37 substats
- Cast #4 costs 110 substats
- Cast #5 costs 230 substats
- Cast #6 costs 370 substats
- Cast #7 costs 1100 substats
- Cast #8 costs 2300 substats
- Cast #9 costs 3700 substats
- Cast #10 costs 11000 substats

Skills marked with 游댮 cost muscle substats, 游댯 cost mysticality substats, and 游릭 cost moxie substats. Skill costs are measured separately for each skill; for example, casting BCZ: Sweat Equity 4 times doesn't increase the cost of BCZ: Sweat Bullets. 

## Speedrun Applicability

This is one of the best speedrunning items released in years. It's a real game-changer. 

## 2024 In-Standard Synergies

- The <Link to="/analysis/2024-09-sept-ember-censer">Sept-Ember Censer</Link> (2024) works wonderfully with this IOTM. Unlike some of our older leveling tools, the Mmm-Brr Mouthwash levels all your stats equally; excess levels can now be shunted into useful tools, which makes Mmm-Brr a bit better than it was before. (And it was already really good!)

## Overall Rating

The blood cubic zirconia is a tier 0 IOTM -- the best tier there is. In a normal speedrun, you save 8-9 turns a day in flat savings from freekills. You can get about 4-5 turns a day saved from clever usage of refracting gaze
